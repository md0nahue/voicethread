Introducing VoiceThread
Your Story. Your Voice. Your Legacy.

When my father passed away, I was left with memories‚Äîbut not his words. Not his voice. Not the full story of who he was, in his own language.

I built VoiceThread because I wished I had something like it before he died. A way to easily sit down, press record, and let him talk. To help guide him through the story of his life, and preserve it‚Äînot just for me, but for my kids and theirs.

That‚Äôs what VoiceThread is:
A powerful, simple tool to capture, organize, and elevate your personal story.
‚ú® For Families & Legacy Builders

Sit down with your parents or grandparents. Let them record their stories, one memory at a time. With VoiceThread, it‚Äôs as easy as talking.
And thanks to built-in AI, their stories can be gently shaped into beautiful narratives‚Äîmemoirs, letters, even full books‚Äîwithout losing their authentic voice.

Don‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs too late. VoiceThread helps you honor the people you love while they‚Äôre still here.
‚úçÔ∏è For Writers & Creators

Whether you‚Äôre a comic, a startup founder, or someone processing a breakup, VoiceThread helps you turn raw experience into refined writing.
Capture your thoughts, day by day. Then, let our AI help you shape those thoughts into essays, ebooks, or full memoirs, 100% rooted in your voice.
