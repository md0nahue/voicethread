Alright, here's how we can break it down:

### 🔧 **How to Implement Monthly Stripe Payments with a Free Trial**

#### 1. **Stripe Setup**
- Create a Stripe account.
- Set up your **Product** (e.g., “VoiceThread Pro”).
- Create a **Monthly Subscription Price**, with a **7-day free trial**:
  - Go to Stripe Dashboard → Products → Add Product.
  - Under pricing, choose **Recurring → Monthly**, then enable **Trial Period = 7 days**.

#### 2. **Backend Logic**
Use Stripe’s **Checkout Session** API or **Stripe Customer Portal**.

##### If using Stripe Checkout:
- Create a checkout session from your backend with:
```json
{
  "mode": "subscription",
  "line_items": [{ "price": "price_abc123", "quantity": 1 }],
  "subscription_data": { "trial_period_days": 7 },
  "success_url": "https://yourapp.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}",
  "cancel_url": "https://yourapp.com/cancel"
}
```

##### If using Stripe Subscriptions directly:
- Create a Customer.
- Create a Subscription with a 7-day trial.
- Save the subscription and customer IDs in your DB.

#### 3. **Frontend Flow**
- Add a “Start Free Trial” button in your app UI.
- When clicked, it calls your backend to generate a Checkout session.
- Redirect the user to the Stripe-hosted checkout page.

#### 4. **Post-Payment Hook**
- Set up a **Webhook** to listen for:
  - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
  - `customer.subscription.created`
  - `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`
- Use this to unlock features or warn them the trial is ending.

### 💸 What’s a Realistic Price Point?

Depends on your audience, but here’s a guideline for SaaS tools like this:

| Tier            | Price     | Notes |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| 🟢 Entry/Hobby    | $5–10/mo  | For casual users |
| 🟡 Standard Pro    | $15–25/mo | For job seekers, creators, coaches |
| 🔴 Enterprise-ish | $50+/mo   | Only if you offer team features or rich analytics |

For a solo creator/interviewer tool with Whisper + LLMs involved, **$15/mo** is a solid start.

**Optional**:
- Offer annual pricing with a discount (e.g., $144/year = 20% off $15/mo).
- Consider tiered pricing if features vary (e.g., number of interviews, storage length, etc.)
